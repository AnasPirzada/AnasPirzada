# Hi, I'm Anas Pirzada

**Full-Stack Engineer | Building Maintainable & Scalable Systems**  
I create software that ages well by solving problems before they become "urgent," ensuring reliability, performance, and clean architecture in every project.  
> Built systems serving thousands of daily users while maintaining high performance and scalability.


### Technical Arsenal

### Engineering Philosophy

* **Performance First** – Optimizing the critical path because users notice milliseconds.  
* **Drama-Free Scaling** – Backend systems that handle growth without midnight alerts.  
* **Clean Architecture** – Writing code that's easier to delete than to break.  
* **Ownership Mindset** – I own features end-to-end—from architecture to deployment.  
* **Intentional Documentation** – Explaining the *why*, not just the *how*.

### Current Focus

Deep-diving into **Distributed Systems**, **Microservices orchestration**, **AI & Machine Learning**, and **performance optimization**.
